# Week-1
Crop &amp; Fertilizer Recommendation System Using Machine Learning A Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is a practical application of machine learning designed to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in optimizing their farming practices. 
Fertilizer and Crop Recommendation Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of two datasets:

Fertilizer Prediction Dataset: Contains information about soil types, fertilizer requirements, and other related features.
Crop Recommendation Dataset: Contains information about different environmental conditions and crop suitability.
The primary goal of this project is to perform a detailed exploration and visualization of the data to extract meaningful insights. It includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

Features
Data Preprocessing

Identification and handling of non-numeric columns.
Encoding categorical data using Label Encoding.
Handling missing or invalid values in the datasets.
Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics of all columns.
Correlation analysis of numeric features with visualizations.
Pairwise comparison of features using scatter plots.
Data Visualization

Heatmaps for correlation analysis (with and without annotations).
Histograms and distribution plots for all numerical columns.
Boxplots to detect outliers in numeric data.
Count plots for categorical columns.
Unique Insights

Detailed breakdown and visualization of each column.
Identification of trends and patterns using graphs.

Insights from Analysis
Fertilizer Dataset:

Correlation analysis reveals key relationships between soil types, fertilizers, and environmental conditions.
Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of soil properties.
Crop Recommendation Dataset:

Analysis shows the suitability of various crops under specific environmental conditions.
Heatmaps and pair plots highlight key factors influencing crop selection.
Future Enhancements
Implement predictive models for fertilizer and crop recommendations.
Add support for interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Dash.
